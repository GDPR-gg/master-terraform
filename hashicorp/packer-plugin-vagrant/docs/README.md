# Vagrant Plugin

The Vagrant plugin integrates Packer with HashiCorp [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), allowing you to use Packer to create development boxes.

- [builder](/docs/builders/vagrant.mdx) - The Vagrant builder is intended for building new boxes from already-existing boxes.

- [post-processor](/docs/post-processors/vagrant.mdx) - The Packer Vagrant post-processor takes a build and converts the artifact into a valid Vagrant box.
