# TFE Release v202103-3 (523)

BUG FIXES SINCE v202103-2:

1. Fixed an issue where certain ephemeral Docker volumes were inadvertently included in Replicated snapshots, leading to snapshot timeouts.

BUG FIXES SINCE v202103-1:

1. Fixed an issue where runs would fail to plan when using Terraform 0.13.x versions created with `terraform-bundle`.

APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:
1. The internally-managed PostgreSQL server has been upgraded from PostgreSQL 9.5 to PostgreSQL 12. Operators should back up their Terraform Enterprise data before upgrading to v202103-1. This change only affects mounted disk and proof of concept installations. Please refer to the "PostgreSQL Upgrade" section for more information.
1. Changed organization name requirements to not be ambiguous with organization ID format. Although very unlikely, if an existing organization name matches a pattern `org-<16 base58 chars>`, it must be renamed.


UPCOMING DEPRECATION NOTIFICATIONS:
1. The Admin API endpoint to list an organization's module consumers has been deprecated, and will be removed in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1. Clients should transition to the new JSON:API compliant endpoint: [List Module Consumers for an Organization](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/admin/organizations.html#list-module-consumers-for-an-organization).
1. The Admin API endpoint to update an organization's module consumers has been deprecated, and will be removed in Terraform Enterprise v202106-1. Clients should transition to the new JSON:API compliant endpoint: [Update an Organization's Module Consumers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/admin/organizations.html#update-an-organization-39-s-module-consumers)

PostgreSQL Upgrade:

The [PostgreSQL versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) states that PostgreSQL 9.5 had its final release on February 11, 2021. As such, the internally-managed PostgreSQL server has been upgraded from PostgreSQL 9.5 to PostgreSQL 12. This change only affects mounted disk and proof of concept installations. It does not affect external services installations.

The first time a Terraform Enterprise installation is upgraded to v202103-1, a program will be executed that will upgrade the PostgreSQL 9.5 data to PostgreSQL 12. This program takes a backup of the PostgreSQL data before upgrading. Regardless, operators should back up their Terraform Enterprise data before upgrading to Terraform Enterprise v202103-1.

Additionally, operators should familiarize themselves with the following knowledge base articles.
