# PTFE Release v201909-3


INSTALLER LEVEL BUG FIXES:
1. Proxy settings for communicating with S3 are now properly honored.

APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:
1. Changed VCS directory filtering to consider trigger paths as directories, not simple prefixes. This means a workspace with a trigger path of "/network" will ignore changes to "/network-security/a/b/c".

APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:
1. Fixed bug: workspaces with file triggering enabled now trigger a run when VCS connection changes, or when created with "queue all runs".
1. Added the ability to configure whether or not TFE will send a passing commit status to pull requests which do not modify files present in a workspace's directory filter.

 APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Changed the top navigation to remain visible for narrower browser widths (until 900px).
1. Changed new workspace page to make it easier to add new VCS connections.
1. Changed VCS provider selection UI to show custom name if specified.
1. Changed the display of status messages for Sentinel policy checks to ensure the result is displayed first.
1. Removed the popover from the workspace index page when hovering over a workspace name.
1. Added workspace name confirmation modal for delete
1. Changed the Sentinel runtime to version 0.10.4. For the latest changes, see the [release notes](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/changelog#0-10-4-august-15-2019-).
1. Added the `destroy` and `requires_new` fields to the diff namespace in the Sentinel `tfplan` import.
1. Added "Learn more" button to account signup page to link to terraform.io
1. Changed workspace creation UI/UX

 APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed an issue that made it look like the last owner could be removed.
1. Fixed an issue with Sentinel mock generation that created errors when processing resources that were being replaced when `create_before_destroy` was set.
1. Fixed an issue with policy checks that created errors when processing resources that were being replaced when `create_before_destroy` was set.
