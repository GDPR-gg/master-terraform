# Waypoint Slack Bot

This is a prototype slack bot that allows slack users the ability to interact with the
waypoint as chatops. The provided functionality is the same as the functionality available
from the `waypoint` CLI.


### Token

The token required by this tool comes out of a [Classic Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_classic_app=1).
The non-Classic Slack Apps do not allow RTM style bots, of which this is one.
