In AWS, a Terraform Enterprise install consists of:

 * Compute Tier
   * Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
   * Single EC2 instance launched as part of an AutoScaling Group (ASG)
 * Data Tier
   * RDS PostgreSQL for primary application storage
   * An S3 Bucket for object storage

### Primary Installation Config Files

The [`aws-standard`](aws-standard/) directory contains the primary Terraform Enterprise installation config files. Its [`README`](aws-standard/README.md) is the next step for learning about how to install Terraform Enterprise.

### Tertiary Terraform Configs

The [`aws-extra`](aws-extra/) directory contains supplementary configs. Its [`README`](aws-extra/README.md) contains a list of descriptions of the configs available.
