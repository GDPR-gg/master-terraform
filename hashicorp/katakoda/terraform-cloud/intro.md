# Terraform Cloud

In this hands-on lab, you'll use the free tier of the hosted Terraform Cloud service to securely save state and execute Terraform remotely. This is a great way to collaborate and secure your Terraform deployments.

This lab serves as a companion piece to the [Migrate State to Terraform Cloud Learn Tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cloud-migrate?in=terraform/state).

In this demo, you'll perform three major tasks:

- Initialize a local Terraform configuration (using the `random_pet` provider) in  your Katacoda session
- Configure a Terraform Cloud token on the local workstation
- Migrate the existing Terraform workspace to Terraform Cloud

We've installed Terraform for you and have given you a small project, so it's ready to go. Let's get started!
