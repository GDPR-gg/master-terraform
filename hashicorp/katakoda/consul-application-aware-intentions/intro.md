# Application Aware Intentions With Consul Service Mesh

In this hands-on lab you will configure and deploy application aware intentions to a pre-existing Consul datacenter.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Check your environments initial status and configuration
- Create intentions to permit service communication inside the service mesh
- Configure an ingress gateway to expose one service outside the mesh
- Create application aware intentions to enable access only to selected path and resources
