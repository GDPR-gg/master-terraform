# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Training Labs
This repository contains open-source training labs for building infrastructure in Google Cloud Platform using [Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit) Terraform [modules](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules).

## Getting Started
The training labs are presented as a set of walkthroughs designed to introduce Terraform, Google Cloud Platform, and Cloud Foundation Toolkit concepts.

To get started, navigate to [00-Setup](00-Setup/README.md) and follow the steps in the README file. You'll need a Google Cloud Platform project to run through the steps.
