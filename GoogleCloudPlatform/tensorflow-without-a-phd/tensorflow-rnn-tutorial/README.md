# RNN Tutorial
This tutorial is a hands-on complement to the "Tensorflow, deep learning and Recurrent Neural Networks" talk ([video](https://youtu.be/fTUwdXUFfI8), [slides](https://goo.gl/UuN41S)). If you are looking for the "Shakespeare" model featured in the talk, you can find it here: [tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare).

All notebooks execute on Google Colaboratory for free. The last exercise runs on a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit).

## Start here

Instructions are provided in each notebook in the section marked [WORK REQUIRED]
