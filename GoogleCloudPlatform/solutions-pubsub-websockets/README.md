_A sample application illustrating how to stream Google [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) messages to a browser using WebSockets_

As more applications embrace an event-driven model, it becomes important that user-interfaces can achieve simple, low-friction connectivity to the messaging services that form the cornerstone of these architectures.

Several options for streaming data to web browser clients are available, the most common of which is WebSockets. This repository contains code  illustrating how to distribute a stream of messages published via Pub/Sub  to a browser front-end using the WebSockets protocol.

See the published GCP [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/streaming-cloud-pub-sub-messages-over-websockets) for full details and instructions.
