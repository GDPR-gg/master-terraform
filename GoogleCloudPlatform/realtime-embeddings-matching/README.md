# Online Embeddings Matching

**This is not an officially supported Google product**. This repo
contains sample codes that demonstrate online embeddings matching
by leveraging Google Cloud Platform and 3rd party libraries.


* **[Text Semantic Search](text-semantic-search/README.md)**: This example shows
how to build an end-to-end real-time text semantic search, using
using the [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/2) 
module for embeddings extraction, and [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
library, for approximate similarity matching index construction.
