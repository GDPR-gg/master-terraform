# Terraform Google Inventory Mapper

This is a Golang library which provides functions to map a Terraform
configuration for Google Cloud Platform into GCP's native API inventory
format, as described by the [Cloud Asset Inventory](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-asset-inventory/overview).

The library is generated using [Magic Modules](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/magic-modules).

This is not an officially supported Google product.
