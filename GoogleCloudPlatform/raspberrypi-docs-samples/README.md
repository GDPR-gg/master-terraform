## Examples of using Google Cloud APIs with Raspberry Pi.

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

This repository contains some scripts that show how various Google Cloud APIs
can be used in Raspberry Pi to create cool things. The code in this repository
is supposed to be run on [Raspbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian).

Samples included:
- [python/vision](./python/vision): Python code that uses
  [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) API.
- [nodejs/speech](./nodejs/speech): Node.js code that uses
  [Google Cloud Speech-To-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/)
  and [Text-To-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/basics)
  API.
