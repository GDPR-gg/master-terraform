# Anthos Bare Metal Edge Use Cases
Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where the action is, to improve response times and save bandwidth. Multiple industries (e.g. Retail, Manufacturing and Energy) are facing a growing demand to provide localized, consistent, low latency services that expose compute services. Workloads range from order management, ML for images/traffic analysis/safety, device management like refrigeration, fryers, etc. [Anthos Bare Metal](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.8) is a unique solution for deploying and managing workloads on clusters distributed across customer data centers and device fleets.
