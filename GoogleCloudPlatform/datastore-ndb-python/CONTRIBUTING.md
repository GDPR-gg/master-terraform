- Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
- Send a pull request.

## Getting Started

You need to separately download and install the App Engine SDK.

Note: There is no guarantee older versions of the App Engine SDK will
work with the current version of ndb.

You can setup your environment by running:

    gcloud components update app-engine-python
    export GAE=$GCLOUD_PATH/platform/google_appengine

If you haven't downloaded `gcloud` yet, you can find it and instructions
about using it on the [Cloud SDK page][1].

## Code Structure

The code is structured into four subdirectories:

- ndb: This is the main code base.  Notable submodules are
  key.py, model.py, query.py, eventloop.py, tasklets.py, and context.py.
  For each module foo.py there's a corresponding foo_test.py which
  contains unit tests for that module.
- demo: This is where demo programs live.  Check out guestbook.py and
  main.py.
- samples: This is where sample code lives.
- tests: This is where additional ndb tests live.

The main directory contains some scripts and auxiliary files.

## Working on ndb

We accept contributions, so if you see something wrong file an issue or
send us a pull request! 

Note: Because this library is included in the App Engine python runtime,
we currently cannot accept any changes that break our existing API
(for now). Additionally, there are restrictions on adding any extra
third party dependencies. 

### Running Tests

Tests can be run using tox.

    tox -e py27

to run coverage tests, run

    tox -e cover
