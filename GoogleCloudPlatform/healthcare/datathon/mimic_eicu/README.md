# Datathon Tutorials

Welcome to datathon on GCP!

We have prepared tutorials to get you started on
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), the tool to filter, join,
aggregate and extract data from the raw datasets for analysis. In each of the
tutorials, some comprehensive examples are included to show how to view the
datasets, run transformations and analyze them.

*   For Python users, please start from the
    [Python colab](http://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare/blob/master/datathon/mimic_eicu/tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.ipynb)
    (a copy is available in the [tutorials](tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.ipynb)
    folder as well), which is a Jupyter notebook hosted in Google Drive, and can
    be shared with other people for collaboration. It has the most comprehensive
    examples, including how to train machine learning models on the MIMIC demo
    dataset with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
*   For people who have experience with R, start with the
    [R tutorial](tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.Rmd), which provides an interactive
    interface to go through the tutorial in RStudio.

    *   Please note that a copy of this tutorial is already included in the
        RStudio servers running on both the shared and private cloud projects.
        All you need to do is:
        *   Go to the
            [Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?) and
            ensure at the top that you are in the shared project;
        *   Find the external IP address of the VM instance under "External IP"
            column (see the first screenshot below);
        *   Visit http://EXTERNAL_IP:8787 (e.g. http://11.22.33.44:8787) from a
            browser.
            *   The username and password should be in the email from the
                organizers.

*   If you are not familiar with either Python or R, start
    [BigQuery web UI](tutorials/bigquery_ui.md), which requires no programming
    experience. With BigQuery web UI, aggregated data can be easily exported as
    CSV files and then processed by other tools.

Have fun!
