# Datathon Tutorials

Welcome to datathon on GCP!

We have prepared tutorials to get you started on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), the tool to filter, join, aggregate and extract data from the raw datasets for analysis. In each of the tutorials, some comprehensive examples are included to show how to view the datasets, run transformations and analyze them.

* For Python users, please start from the [Python colab](http://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare/blob/master/datathon/cms_medicare/tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.ipynb) (a copy is available in the [tutorials](tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.ipynb) folder as well), which is a Jupyter notebook hosted in Google Drive, and can be shared with other people for collaboration. It has the most comprehensive examples, including how to train machine learning models on the CMS Medicare dataset with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* For people who have experience with R, start with the [R tutorial](tutorials/bigquery_tutorial.Rmd), which provides an interactive interface to go through the tutorial in RStudio.

* If you are not familiar with either Python or R, start [BigQuery web UI](tutorials/bigquery_ui.md), which requires no programming experience. With BigQuery web UI, aggregated data can be easily exported as CSV files and then processed by other tools.

Have fun!
