# Getting Started - ANZICS Datathon

Welcome to the [ANZICS Core Critical Care
Datathon](http://datathon.anzics.com.au/)!

To help you familiarize yourself to accessing and analyzing the data, we
prepared a tutorial. Please find it

*   as a [Colab
    notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare/blob/master/datathon/anzics18/tutorial.ipynb)
    or download the [raw `.ipynb` notebook](tutorial.ipynb) and open in your own
    Jupyter environment, if you prefer Python access;
*   as an [RStudio notebook](tutorial.Rmd), if you prefer R access.

If you use other analysis tools in which native BigQuery access is not
available, you may be able to access BigQuery by using ODBC/JDBC connection.
See [an example in Matlab](tutorial.matlab).
