This directory contains proto files and the associated generated code. Run `updatepb.sh`
when you modify an existing proto file, or add a new proto file. To support Go, ensure
proto files use proto3: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3

Layout:
 go/            Generated Go code. Don't edit by hand.
 py/            Generated Python code. Don't edit by hand.
 *.proto        Proto files. Edit these.
 updatepb.sh    Script to update generated code.

Packaging:

Go code is vended as the module `github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/compute-image-tools/proto/go`
See `cli_tools/go.mod` for an example of consuming this.

Python code is vended as a Python package called `compute_image_tools_proto`. See these
files for example usage:
  * daisy_workflows/image_import/inspection/
                                        setup.py
                                        pyproject.toml
                                        daisy-shim.sh
