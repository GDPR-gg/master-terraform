	// Challenge is the identifier ("login challenge") of the login request. It is used to
	// identify the session.
	Challenge string `json:"challenge,omitempty"`

	// RequestURL is the original OAuth 2.0 Authorization URL requested by the OAuth 2.0 client. It is the URL which
	// initiates the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code or OAuth 2.0 Implicit flow. This URL is typically not needed, but
	// might come in handy if you want to deal with additional request parameters.

	// SessionID is the login session ID. If the user-agent reuses a login session (via cookie / remember flag)
	// this ID will remain the same. If the user-agent did not have an existing authentication session (e.g. remember is false)
	// this will be a new random value. This value is used as the "sid" parameter in the ID Token and in OIDC Front-/Back-
	// channel logout. It's value can generally be used to associate consecutive login requests by a certain user.
	SessionID string `json:"session_id,omitempty"`

	// Skip, if true, implies that the client has requested the same scopes from the same user previously.
	// If true, you can skip asking the user to grant the requested scopes, and simply forward the user to the redirect URL.

	// This feature allows you to update / set session information.
	// Deprecated: we built our own consent remember feature, do not use hydra remember feature.
	Skip bool `json:"skip,omitempty"`

	// Subject is the user ID of the end-user that authenticated. Now, that end user needs to grant or deny the scope
	// requested by the OAuth 2.0 client. If this value is set and `skip` is true, you MUST include this subject type
	// when accepting the login request, or the request will fail.
