type OpenIDConnectContext struct {

	// ACRValues is the Authentication AuthorizationContext Class Reference requested in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization request.
	// It is a parameter defined by OpenID Connect and expresses which level of authentication (e.g. 2FA) is required.
	//
	// OpenID Connect defines it as follows:
	// > Requested Authentication AuthorizationContext Class Reference values. Space-separated string that specifies the acr values
	// that the Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing this Authentication Request, with the
	// values appearing in order of preference. The Authentication AuthorizationContext Class satisfied by the authentication
	// performed is returned as the acr Claim Value, as specified in Section 2. The acr Claim is requested as a
	// Voluntary Claim by this parameter.
	ACRValues []string `json:"acr_values"`

	// Display is a string value that specifies how the Authorization Server displays the authentication and consent user interface pages to the End-User.
	// The defined values are:
	// page: The Authorization Server SHOULD display the authentication and consent UI consistent with a full User Agent page view. If the display parameter is not specified, this is the default display mode.
	// popup: The Authorization Server SHOULD display the authentication and consent UI consistent with a popup User Agent window. The popup User Agent window should be of an appropriate size for a login-focused dialog and should not obscure the entire window that it is popping up over.
	// touch: The Authorization Server SHOULD display the authentication and consent UI consistent with a device that leverages a touch interface.
	// wap: The Authorization Server SHOULD display the authentication and consent UI consistent with a "feature phone" type display.
	//
	// The Authorization Server MAY also attempt to detect the capabilities of the User Agent and present an appropriate display.
	Display string `json:"display,omitempty"`

	// IDTokenHintClaims are the claims of the ID Token previously issued by the Authorization Server being passed as a hint about the
	// End-User's current or past authenticated session with the Client.
	IDTokenHintClaims map[string]interface{} `json:"id_token_hint_claims,omitempty"`

	// LoginHint hints about the login identifier the End-User might use to log in (if necessary).
	// This hint can be used by an RP if it first asks the End-User for their e-mail address (or other identifier)
	// and then wants to pass that value as a hint to the discovered authorization service. This value MAY also be a
	// phone number in the format specified for the phone_number Claim. The use of this parameter is optional.
	LoginHint string `json:"login_hint,omitempty"`

	// UILocales is the End-User'id preferred languages and scripts for the user interface, represented as a
	// space-separated list of BCP47 [RFC5646] language tag values, ordered by preference. For instance, the value
	// "fr-CA fr en" represents a preference for French as spoken in Canada, then French (without a region designation),
	// followed by English (without a region designation). An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested
	// locales are not supported by the OpenID Provider.
	UILocales []string `json:"ui_locales"`
