# Automating IoT Machine Learning: Bridging Cloud and Device Benefits with Cloud ML Engine

The following code accompanies the [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/automating-iot-machine-learning) - which
includes the full walkthrough.

The workflow:

 - Trains ML model versions using Cloud Machine Learning Engine.
 - Uses photorealistic CAD-rendered data to train the ML model.
 - Automates the packaging and delivery of the new or modified model to a remote IoT device where the inference (model prediction) runs locally.
