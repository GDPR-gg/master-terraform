# Experimental extensions

This repository contains the source for experimental extensions. Created by Google Cloud, these experimental extensions may be useful in your project, but *don't have the same level of testing and support as the [official extensions](https://github.com/firebase/extensions)*.

> New to Extensions? You can learn more at the [Firebase Extensions product page](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions).

Each directory in this repo contains the source code for an extension and a README to explain how the extension works, including information about the APIs enabled, resources created, and the access granted to the extension.
