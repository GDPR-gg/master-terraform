# Knative Build - Docker build

The previous tutorial taught you how to setup Knative Build on a Kubernetes cluster. You ran a simple Build
that prints "Hello, World!".

Let's try a more concrete build: **building a Docker image**.

## What am I going to learn?

 1. This new tutorial, will show you how to build a Docker image described by a **Dockerfile**.
 2. You'll setup credentials to push that image to a registry.
 2. It'll show you how to extract common build configuration into a Build Template.

**Time to complete:** <walkthrough-tutorial-duration duration="10"></walkthrough-tutorial-duration>

**Are you ready?** Then click the `Continue` button to get started...

## Build a Docker image

We are going to build a very simple website with [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/).
The sources are on [GitHub](https://github.com/dgageot/hello).
A [Dockerfile](https://github.com/dgageot/hello/blob/master/Dockerfile)
describes the image to be built.

<walkthrough-spotlight-pointer spotlightId="devshell-web-editor-button">Open the file editor</walkthrough-spotlight-pointer>.
Here's the Kubernetes <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="knative-build-tutorials/docker-build/build.yaml">yaml manifest</walkthrough-editor-open-file> to express such a build:

```yaml
apiVersion: build.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: docker-build
spec:
  serviceAccountName: knative-build
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/dgageot/hello.git
      revision: master
  steps:
  - name: build-and-push
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.1.0
    args:
    - --dockerfile=/workspace/Dockerfile
    - --destination=gcr.io/[PROJECT-NAME]/hello-nginx
```

A few things look different than the simpler "Hello, World!" build, right?

**Click the `Continue` button to understand those differences...**

## Git source

This time, the build will need sources to build an artifact. So we define
a source where to get those sources from:

```yaml
source:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/dgageot/hello.git
    revision: master
```

**Kaniko**

[Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) will be used
to build a Docker image. Just running `docker build` [would be unsafe on a
shared cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/1806).

```yaml
- name: build-and-push
  image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.1.0
```

**Service Account**

Once the image is built, it'll be pushed to [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/).
Or any registry in fact, but we'll demonstrate with GCR.
The build requires a service account to be granted the right to push.

```yaml
serviceAccountName: knative-build
```

This will be done by creating a Kubernetes [Service Account](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/)
that has access to a Google Cloud [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts).

**That's a lot of Service Accounts! Click the `Continue` button to do this step by step...**

## Configure access to Google Container Registry

Giving a Build the permisison to push to [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/)
requires 4 steps:

 + Create a [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) in your Google Cloud project. It needs to be be granted push access to GCR.
 + Create a [JSON key](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#json_key_file) for that Service Account.
 + Store this key in a [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).
 + Create a Kubernetes [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts) that has access to this secret.

Once those steps are done, we can create as many builds as we want that share those permissions.

**Click the `Continue` button to follow those steps...**

## Create a Google Cloud Service Account

The first part of the configuration is on the Google Cloud side.

### Make sure gcloud CLI talks to the right project

```bash
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECTID]
```

```bash
PROJECTID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

### Create a Service Account

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create knative-build --display-name "Knative Build"
```

### Allow it to push to GCR

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECTID --member serviceAccount:knative-build@$PROJECTID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/storage.admin
```

### Create a JSON key

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create knative-key.json --iam-account knative-build@$PROJECTID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This creates a <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="knative-build-tutorials/knative-key.json">knative-key.json</walkthrough-editor-open-file> file on your drive.

**You are almost there!** You completed the Google Cloud part.

**Click the `Continue` button to complete the Kubernetes part...**

## Create a Kubernetes Service Account

### Create a secret for the JSON Key

First, create a Kubernetes secret from the JSON key:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic knative-build-auth --type="kubernetes.io/basic-auth" --from-literal=username="_json_key" --from-file=password=knative-key.json
```

To tell the Build to use those parameters when pushing to `gcr.io`, we
need to add an annotation to the secret. That's called [Guided credential selection](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/build/auth.md#guiding-credential-selection).

```bash
kubectl annotate secret knative-build-auth build.knative.dev/docker-0=https://gcr.io
```

### Create a Service Account

We can eventually create a Service Account in Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f docker-build/service-account.yaml
```

**You are done! Continue to next step to run the build...**

## Run the Build

OK, we've got everything configured to let the Build push images to a registry.

One last step is to edit <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="knative-build-tutorials/docker-build/build.yaml">docker-build/build.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
and replace `[PROJECT-NAME]` with your project id.
This way, the build will push the image to the Google Container Registry linked to your project.

Run the build:

```bash
kubectl apply -f docker-build/build.yaml
```

The build is running:

```bash
kubectl get builds
```

Tail the logs with:

```bash
logs docker-build
```

**Congratulations! You have built and pushed a Docker image with Knative Build.**

**Continue to next step, to improve the build file...**

## Build Templates

Now that you became familiar with expressing Docker builds, you will
want to avoid copy/pasting the same boilerplate yaml each time a new
image needs to be built.

[Build Templates](https://github.com/knative/docs/blob/master/build/build-templates.md)
solve that problem by extracting the common yaml to a shared parameterized template.

### Create a Template

A <walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="knative-build-tutorials/docker-build/template.yaml">Build Template</walkthrough-editor-open-file>
for a Docker build looks like that:

```yaml
apiVersion: build.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: BuildTemplate
metadata:
  name: docker-build
spec:
  parameters:
  - name: IMAGE
    description: Where to publish the resulting image.
  - name: DIRECTORY
    description: The directory containing the build context.
    default: "/workspace"
  - name: DOCKERFILE_NAME
    description: The name of the Dockerfile
    default: Dockerfile
  steps:
  - name: build-and-push
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.1.0
    args:
    - --dockerfile=/${DIRECTORY}/{DOCKERFILE_NAME}
    - --destination=${IMAGE}
```

It's a list of steps and a list of parameters, some of which have default
values that can be overriden by a build.

Let's register this template into Kubernetes.

```bash
kubectl apply -f docker-build/template.yaml
```

### Use the Template

Now, the Build can be simplified by referencing the template and by
providing the right values for each parameter.

```yaml
apiVersion: build.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: docker-build-hello
spec:
  serviceAccountName: knative-build
  source:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/dgageot/hello.git
      revision: master
  template:
    name: docker-build
    arguments:
    - name: IMAGE
      value: gcr.io/[PROJECT-NAME]/hello-nginx
```

**Click the `Continue` button to run the templated build...**

## Run the Templated Build

*Warning*: don't forget to replace `[PROJECT-NAME]` with you actual
project name in
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="knative-build-tutorials/docker-build/build-hello.yaml">docker-build/build-hello.yaml</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

Run the build:

```bash
kubectl apply -f docker-build/build-hello.yaml
```

The build is running:

```bash
kubectl get builds
```

Tail the logs with:

```bash
logs docker-build-hello
```

## Congratulations!

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Woot! You've used a Build Template for the first time. You are an advanced
user now!

**Why not build a more complicated Java application?**
