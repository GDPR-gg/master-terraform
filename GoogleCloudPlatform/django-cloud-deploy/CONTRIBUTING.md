# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see

again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Style guidelines

All code submissions should follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md) and should
be formatted using [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf).

YAPF can be installed and run with:

```bash
pip install yapf
yapf -i <file>  # Updates the formatting of <file>
```
